# Computer-Networks-eecs489-project1

This is the project 1 of Computer Networks course.

iPerf is a common tool used to measure network bandwidth. Write my own version of this tool in C/C++ using sockets. Then use my tools to measure the performance of virtual networks in Mininet and explain how link characteristics and multiplexing impact performance.
